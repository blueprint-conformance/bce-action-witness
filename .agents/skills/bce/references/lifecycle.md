# BCE contract lifecycle reference

Read this only for contract creation, adoption, governance, or proof work. For an ordinary RED →
code fix → GREEN task, the primary `SKILL.md` is sufficient.

## Install and discriminate

Use an exact provenance-backed version, never a range or `latest` for a merge gate:

```bash
npm view bce-engine@0.3.0 version dist.integrity
npm install --save-dev --save-exact bce-engine@0.3.0
npx --no-install bce demo
```

The demo must produce GREEN and RED. A gate no one has seen fail is not evidence.

That immutable release includes both TypeScript/JavaScript and Python direct-module graphs.

## Propose first

When the installed exact release exposes `bce propose`, start from a committed repository state and
an authoritative intent file:

```bash
bce propose \
  --repo . \
  --intent-file docs/architecture-intent.md \
  --assistant openai-responses \
  --assistant-model '<exact provider model id>' \
  --new
```

Use `--base <path>` instead of `--new` for an existing policy. Inspect the disclosure preview before
the network call. Treat the model plan as untrusted: only the deterministic review packet is a
reviewable artifact, and it is still draft-only. Read `docs/ai-first-review.md` for the GitHub-bound
decision and ratify/amend ceremony.

## Manual author fallback

If no proposal adapter is available or the user explicitly requires an offline draft, derive the
contract from the real tree. Never hand-write blueprint JSON: `author` owns schema, canonical
serialization, and the non-empty scope check.

```bash
bce author \
  --id parameterized-queries-only \
  --intent-ref policy/no-string-built-sql \
  --constraint 'forbiddenPattern:SELECT .*\$\{:critical' \
  --extraction-profile plugin-surface \
  --scope-paths "src/**/*.ts" \
  --min-files 1 \
  --repo . \
  --out parameterized-queries-only.blueprint.json
```

Constraint grammar is `<type>:<argument>[:<severity>]`; severity is `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`,
or `critical`.

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `forbiddenDependency` | a surface must not import a module |
| `requiredDependency` | a component must carry a required edge |
| `requiredComponent` | an architectural component must exist |
| `forbiddenPath` | an extracted component must not match a path glob |
| `forbiddenFile` | a raw scanned file must not exist |
| `forbiddenPattern` | a source line must not match a safe regex |
| `forbiddenEgress` | network destinations are blocked or allowlisted |
| `behavioralInvariant` | runtime evidence must satisfy a behavior reference |

`requiredEvidence`, `minimumMetric`, and `customPolicy` are reserved/run-only in v0.1; do not use
one as the enforcing constraint in a first blueprint. Extraction profiles are
`next-route-handler`, `plugin-surface`, `python-import-surface`, `typescript-module-graph`, and
`python-module-graph` in the released `v0.3.0` binary. The direct-module profiles require explicit
scope paths, use `module:`, `package:`, or `builtin:` dependency targets, and automatically write
`minEngineVersion: "0.3.0"`. Follow `docs/typescript-module-graph.md` or
`docs/python-module-graph.md`. The normal primary skill loop remains unchanged: after setup,
`doctor_repository {}` diagnoses readiness and zero-argument MCP `run_gate {}` grades the live
module graph through the same engine as the CLI.

Validate the draft:

```bash
bce validate --blueprint parameterized-queries-only.blueprint.json
```

## Onboard without approving

```bash
bce onboard \
  --repo . \
  --blueprint parameterized-queries-only.blueprint.json \
  --engine bce-engine@0.3.0 \
  --harness codex
```

This exact onboarding command supports the framework, import-surface, and direct-module profiles in
`v0.3.0`.

Harnesses are `agents`, `claude`, `cursor`, and `codex`. Onboarding installs project skills, agent
context, project-local MCP configuration, immutable CI, advisory mode, and an adoption manifest. It
does not ratify the draft. Existing context and unrelated MCP servers/settings must survive.

## Prove the contract

Working-tree run:

```bash
bce run --blueprint <path> --ct-repo . --no-pin --extractor ast --out compliance-report.json
```

Non-vacuity assessment:

```bash
bce teeth --blueprint <path> --ct-repo . --no-pin --extractor ast
```

`toothed` means extractor-real evidence can refute at least one constraint. `evaluator-refutable`
is synthetic evaluator evidence only. `toothless` exits `2`. The substance proof is a real planted
defect: clean GREEN → planted RED with the promised anchor → corrected GREEN.

Whole-repository done-check:

```bash
bce gate --repo . --extractor ast --all
```

`gate` scans live files. `run` pins committed `HEAD` unless `--no-pin` is explicit. Never confuse a
pinned GREEN with proof of an uncommitted correction.

## Brownfield adoption

1. **Advisory:** reports the full real verdict but does not block. Exit `0` can still contain RED.
2. **Baseline:** records existing violations. It may only shrink; new violations block.
3. **Graduate:** turns enforcement on. Downgrading requires an explicit reviewed rationale.

Useful attended commands:

```bash
bce baseline --repo . --dry-run
bce graduate --repo .
bce graduate --repo . --downgrade --rationale "reviewed reason"
```

Ratification, amendments, mode changes, baseline changes, waivers, workflows, and engine pins are
policy changes. Keep them separate from code repairs. Ratify/amend require the exact review packet,
an approving decision derived from a GitHub pull-request review, current maintain/admin permission,
and live SCM re-authentication; do not supply or invent reviewer identity locally. After ratify/amend
prepares the policy commit, obtain the repository's normal fresh CODEOWNER/required review before
merge; the packet decision is not a substitute for final branch protection.

## CI invariants

- Pin an exact npm version or immutable 40-character Action commit.
- Do not put a workflow-level path filter on a required check; let BCE self-scope.
- Run on pull requests and merge queues where required.
- Treat exit `1` and `2` as RED.
- Keep policy operations absent from MCP.
- Never claim creator-operated or model-operated evidence is independent confirmation.
